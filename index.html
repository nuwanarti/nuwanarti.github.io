    <h4>GPS receivers for tracking animals (Sea Turtle Tracking )</h4>
    <p>The aim is to develop GPS-GSM devices for tracking sea turtles based upon GSM mobile phone technology and GPS snapshot data. While turtle is surfacing for breathing/basking,
       the transmitter records GPS data (about 12 ms) in internal memory and transfer data via GSM while animal is in GMS signal range (near-shore ...<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/project/GPS-receivers-for-tracking-animals-Sea-Turtle-Tracking">read more..</a></p>
    <h4>Particulate matter time-series and KÃ¶ppen-Geiger climate classes in North America and Europe Article</h4>
    <p>Four years of time-series data on the particulate matter (PM) concentrations from 801 monitoring stations located in Europe and 234 stations in North America were analyzed.
       Using k-means clustering with distance correlation as a measure for similarity, ...<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310800518_Particulate_matter_time-series_and_Koppen-Geiger_climate_classes_in_North_America_and_Europe">read more...</a></p>
    <h4>Particulate matter (PM10) patterns in Europe: An exploratory data analysis using non-negative matrix factorization</h4>
    <p>In last decade space-density of monitoring stations increased, in to addition also air pollution modeling made big progress. Using diversity of big data can lead to better knowledge about air
      pollution at continental scale. The focus of presented study is the data-driven approach...<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/297137021_Particulate_matter_PM10_patterns_in_Europe_An_exploratory_data_analysis_using_non-negative_matrix_factorization"></a></p>
